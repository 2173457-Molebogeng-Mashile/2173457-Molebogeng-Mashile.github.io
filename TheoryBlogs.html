                    The tutorial videos were really helpful but also quite long. The lecturers were clear in their explanation of difficult concepts such as
                     JavaScript functions.
                     I was able to go through the material at my own pace which allowed me to fully understand the topics being covered. 
                    
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I found that breaking up the tasks into smaller pieces made them more manageable and much easier to complete. It also allowed me to really
                        focus on one concept rather than trying to juggle a lot of information all at once.
                        Knowing that I could pause or rewatch sections as needed gave me additional confidence in my ability to practice and understand the work.
                         <br>

                         I find the topic of internet art quite interesting. There are so many ways to create art on the internet, this sparks many different ideas of art
                          I would like to create. From coding my own art projects to digital painting, I see so many opportunities to explore.  Internet artwork has become 
                          a powerful tool in the art community due to its creative potential and unlimited resources it provides. It's exciting being able to create something
                           unique with technology and share it with people who appreciate your work. With more individuals using technology as an outlet for their creativity, 
                           internet artwork is constantly evolving and growing into something new every day.
                          As an artist, I am always looking forward to seeing what comes next in this ever-changing world of internet artwork.

                    As I continued working through the videos, as well as other tutorial videos on YouTube, the concepts became sort of second
                     nature. Concepts such as HTML tags, CSS layouts, and JavaScript functions are no longer so difficult for me to understand
                      anymore 

                     <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, I think I am making good progress and these resources have been extremely helpful for learning web development. 
                    I have learned new concepts, deepened my understanding of existing ones, and gave me the confidence I needed to continue honing my skills.  
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I am finding that Internet artwork is not limited to just creating digital images and illustrations, but can also include video, music, and interactive content.
                      These creative endeavors allow me to think about new ways to combine traditional art with modern technology in a way that allows my work to stand out from the crowd.
                       Not only does creating internet art offer an outlet for self-expression, but it also serves as a platform for communication between people who may have never met before. 
 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating internet artwork; whether I am experimenting with new techniques or combining different mediums, I am always thinking of ways
                       pushing the boundaries of what is possible. My goal is to use this platform to create artwork that will inspire others and help shape our understanding of the world around us.
