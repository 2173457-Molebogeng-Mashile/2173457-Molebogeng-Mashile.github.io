                    <h1>Wonderful place to live</h1>
                    South Africa has some of the most beautiful places to live, from the large cities such as Johannesburg or Cape Town to the wildlife estates in the countryside, there is something for everybody.

                    The country is unique because it sits on both sides of an equator, which gives it a warm climate all year round. The weather varies from region to region and from day to night, but it is always warm and sunny.

                     <br>
                    The mountains in South Africa are covered with snow until early summer, when they melt away into lush green pastures full of grazing animals like zebras and giraffes. This is where you will find some of the most beautiful national parks in South Africa.
                    It's also a place where many people choose to retire because of its warm climate, low crime rate, and high quality medical care system.
