                    My internet artwork is inspired by the racial issues in South Africa. In the Apartheid era, Black South Africans were not allowed in "white areas" among many other discriminations.
                     These "white areas" were occupied by people who had wealth. To this day, "white areas" still exist since they are meant for the wealthy, and the wealthy in the country are primarily white.
                      Through my internet art, I want to depict what it would be like for black people to occupy these spaces. I want to show the contrast between
                     the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy whites and the struggles that come with living in a largely impoverished black area.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Through my artwork, I hope to express what it is like for black South Africans today who have endured so much oppression in their past, yet still remain strong and resilient
                         despite their circumstances. It is my hope that this artwork sparks a dialogue about racism and brings attention to the socioeconomic disparities in South Africa, while also highlighting
                          its potential for progress. By fusing traditional art techniques with digital images, I am able to create something unique and visually striking that conveys an important message.

                         <br>
                         <br>
                         I plan on taking the art on the internet route my making advertisement about people should choose to live in South Africa. 
                         I plan on showing wealthy cities, houses and schools but instead of who you would usually see in this places, they will be replaced by the poor.
                          This will be sort of a race swapping advert, as rich white people will be replaced by poor black people in their space. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This artwork was inspired by the banned 2004 advert by Laurence Hamburger, Ya Mampela, where we follow a white man going about his day in a township. As we follow him, 
                        we see the different interaction he has with other white people as well as his interactions with wealthier, more privileged black people. I think this advert is interesting
                         because it may have different meanings to different people. As a black person, I found myself judging it closely and looking for all the things they got wrong about the black experience.
                          Also, seeing white and black South Africans being depicted like this is a bit unsettling as it is something I have never seen. I have never seen a township full of white people, let alone white
                           people living black lives and doing things so synonymous with black South African culture. For white people, I would imagine this advert also means something different, maybe it makes them feel 
                           uncomfortable being the ones who got the short end of the stick, or maybe it makes them guilty or empathetic towards black people. I don't know, but I think this advert did a great job at highlighting
                            the devastating inequality in this country that still exists today.

                <p>
                    For my artwork, I still want to keep the advert idea, but instead of race swapping, I will show an advert of all the good of South Africa blocked
                     by all the bad. The ad will aim to persuade the reader to choose South Africa, but the reader will have a difficult time reading the information as
                      there will be a large popup ad asking for donations to help the poor. This ad symbolizes how we as a country have ignored all the negative in favor of all the positive.
                       This country has examples of both extreme wealth and extreme poverty, and I want to emphasize that. There is an Image of the city of Cape Town as this city is a prime example
                        of only focusing on the positive and ignoring the negative. In this ad, you can't ignore the negative. It stares you right in the face and forces you to deal with it.  
                     <br>
                     I chose the image of a poor family that greatly contrasts with the wealth that is in the background. The fact that it is asking for a donation that you don't give is a reflection of how
                      we treat poor people in real life. Often, we ignore beggars on the street that are also asking for very little. I know that there are many reasons we might do this to others, but as soon 
                      as we get them out of sight, we forget about them. Having the ability to move it around the page and not make it disappear, makes it harder for the reader to ignore the truth.

                     <br>
                     My artwork also serves as a form of protest against oppressive systems and regimes. It speaks to our shared struggle for justice and fairness.
                      In an increasingly digital world, it is important for us to use the internet as a platform for promoting social awareness and activism.
