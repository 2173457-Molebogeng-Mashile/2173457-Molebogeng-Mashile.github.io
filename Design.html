                <h1> UI/UX Design</h1>
                <br>
                           <br>

                <p>
                    For my webpage, the goal was to create a clean and easy to navigate page, a color scheme of black, blue, and white.
                     I wanted to keep the layout simple, yet stylish. To achieve this, I implemented a classic three-column structure that used white
                      space effectively and allowed for text and images to be easily read by visitors. The navigation menu was clear with simple icons to 
                      represent each page, and the overall site design was made mobile friendly. With an emphasis on typography, I chose a font that conveyed
                       an air of professionalism while still being fun and easy to read on all devices. Colors were kept minimal with a basic black/blue/white
                        color palette to ensure the focus remained on content. In order to guarantee users would be able to find their way around easily, links
                         were clearly labeled and organized in the navigation menu for easy access. All in all, my personal web page design is built to be user-friendly, 
                         easily navigable, and visually appealing. Through careful attention to detail and thoughtful design choices, I am confident that my website will 
                         provide a positive experience for any visitor who visits it.  


                         <br>
                         <br>
                         I also put an emphasis on creating content which was concise and well organized so that the message of my personal website was easily conveyed.
                          To do this, I used headings, subheadings, and other visual elements such as images to draw attention to important information.
                          This approach ensures users are able to quickly gain the information they are searching for and engage with the interface.  
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          In addition to using visuals, I also used white space strategically in order to make the entire website look more inviting and organized.
                           This was especially important when it came to creating mobile-friendly designs, as I had to ensure the page layout was still easy to navigate
                            on a smaller screen size. It was also essential that all of my webpages had strong typography and colors which were consistent across different devices.
                           These features allow users to have an impressive experience no matter what device they are viewing my personal website from.  
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           By taking these UI/UX design considerations into account, I am confident that visitors will be able to find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
